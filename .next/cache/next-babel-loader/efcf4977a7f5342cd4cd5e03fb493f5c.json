My name is Peter Fulton and I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer. I found my passion in programming when I first learned Python for an undergraduate research position at the University of Connecticut.

The program took this data and created time dependent scatter plots to determine if any correlations existed between chemical species at time t vs t+1. Linear, second order and third order correlations were examined in all cases.

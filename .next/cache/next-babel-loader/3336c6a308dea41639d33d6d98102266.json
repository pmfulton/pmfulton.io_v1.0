My name is Peter Fulton and I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer. I found my passion in programming when I first learned Python for an undergraduate research position at the University of Connecticut. My goal was to create a data analysis program that parsed through a .csv file containing two years of chemical species data collected from a WPCF facility on campus. The program took this data and created time dependent scatter plots to determine if any correlations existed between chemical species at time t vs t+1. Linear, second order and third order correlations were examined in all cases. Ever since my first encounter with Python, I have loved programming and have taught myself fundamentals of different languages such as javascript, java & C++. While I mainly work in python and javascript, I am always looking for new opportunities to test my skills with other languages.\")));\n}\n\n_c = AboutMe;\nexport default AboutMe;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"AboutMe\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["D:/github_repos/pmf-portfolio/pmf-portfolio/pages/about.js"],"names":["Button","AboutMe"],"mappings":";;;AAAA,OAAOA,MAAP,MAAoB,yBAApB;;AAGA,SAASC,OAAT,GAAmB;AACf,SACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI,MAAC,MAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oDAFJ,EAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,w4BAHJ,CAFJ,CADJ;AAmBH;;KApBQA,O;AAsBT,eAAeA,OAAf","sourcesContent":["import Button from  \"../components/Button.js\"\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction AboutMe() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <html>\r\n\r\n            <body>\r\n                <Button />\r\n                <h1>Peter Fulton - B.S.E in Chemical Engineering</h1>\r\n                <div>\r\n                Hi!
